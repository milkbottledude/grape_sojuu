- Conclusion
 As we can see from holowiki_figure.png, enmyth has the greatest number of total subscribers. 2nd in place is gen3, then gen0, which is followed closely by gamers.
 From holowiki_figure_avgsubs.png, while it is true that enmyth has the greatest average subscriber count, that is largely due to one talent in particular, Gawr Gura, pulling up the average greatly and somewhat skewing the findings. Gen3 on the other hand has multiple talents with a large subscriber count. Perhaps it would be more accurate to calculate median to avoid such right-skewed distributions.
